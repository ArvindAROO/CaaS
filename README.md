# Captioning-as-a-Service

Have you ever wanted a personal meme editor to add whatever caption you want? CaaS does exactly that even though there are many options that are way simpler to use, you have to use CaaS, coz it has "as a service" in its name and saying you edit memes on instagram is too middle class.

The main idea of our project is allowing anyone to give anything as captions to whatever image they want. The project has been deployed on heroku and can be used anytime.

# How to use CaaS

All you need to do to use CaaS is upload the image you want to add caption to and type the caption you want. The base URL is ```https://caasapp.herokuapp.com/```.
